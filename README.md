## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - For testing

### What I learned

- How to write extensible media quieries using mixins and Sass variables
- Sass will be deprecating @import. Recommended to utilize @use instead
- How to leverage responsive units
- Planning and implementing layouts using Flexbox
- Why margin collapse happens and how to resolve it
- Using assertions from the Jest-Dom library

Overall this project was a great opportunity to practice building a design handed off to me with a set of specific style guidelines. Given the simplistic nature of the project, I was also able to successfully practice an approach using test driven development.

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to continue practicing the following:

- Using responsive units
- Meeting WCAG AA accessibility standards
- Writing media queries with Scss
- Building layouts using Flexbox
- Unit testing with Jest
- Developing with a mobile first approach

Additionally, I'd like to return to this project and implement the following:

- TypeScript
- Styled Components

### Useful resources

- [Test-Driven Development for Building User Interfaces](https://blog.testproject.io/2021/03/23/test-driven-development-for-building-user-interfaces/) - This helped me understand the workflow behind test driven development in a frontend context. With a better understanding, and experience now as well, I feel much more confident and willing to build using TDD.
- [Introducing Sass Modules](https://www.example.com) - This article was great for helping me understand Sass modules better, and particularly how @use works. I'd recommend it to anyone that needs help understanding the nuances of namespacing.
